## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a web page for Horiseon that followed the accessibility standards and improved the site for search engines.  I accomplished this by improving the structure and semantic elements of the HTML and also refactored the CSS, (paraphrasing) "leaving the code better than I found it".  I used HTML and CSS to build this web page.

You can navigate the site by using the links to the right side of the header.  Clicking on one of these, for example, "Search Engine Optimization", will bring you to the corresponding section on the page.  There is additional information located in the right-hand sidebar.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency\
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards\
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards\
WHEN I view the source code\
THEN I find semantic HTML elements\
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements\
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning\
WHEN I view the image elements\
THEN I find accessible alt attributes\
WHEN I view the heading attributes\
THEN they fall in sequential order\
WHEN I view the title element\
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
