# Code Refactor Starter Code

Horiseon SEO Web Page


Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a web page for Horiseon that followed the accessibility standards and improved the site for search engines.  I accomplished this by improving the structure and semantic elements of HTML and also refactored the CSS, (paraphrasing) "leaving the code better than I found it".
